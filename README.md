## 🌟 What is this?

**ViralPost** is a client-side AI tool designed to fix the "Blank Page Problem." 
Instead of struggling to write the perfect prompt, you just type a rough idea (e.g., "I want a website for coffee"), and this tool transforms it into a **professional specification** using the latest AI models.

It features specialized modes for:
*   📱 **Viral Social Media:** Turns boring updates into punchy LinkedIn/Twitter hooks.
*   🎨 **UI/UX Design:** Generates detailed Tailwind color palettes, layouts, and design specs.
*   💻 **Coding:** Creates precise technical requirements for developers.
*   🖼️ **Image Gen:** Write prompts optimized for Midjourney v7 and DALL-E 3.

## 🤖 Supported Models
We support a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) architecture. Your keys are stored **locally in your browser** and never sent to our servers.

*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (Fast & Efficient)
*   **Gemini 3 Pro** (Deep Reasoning)
*   **GPT-5** (OpenAI's Newest Flagship)
*   **GPT-4o** (Reliable & Fast)
*   **Llama 3.3** (Free & Open Source via Groq)
